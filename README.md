SteamAuth for NodeJS
====================

Implementation of mobile SteamGuard 2FA codes and trading confirmations.

<br><br>

## Installation

Expand latest SteamAuth-X.X.X.zip into your project folder.

<br><br>

## Usage

### Authenticator codes

Add require.

```js
var SteamAuth = require("steamauth"); // if using npm registry
	
var SteamAuth = require("./SteamAuth"); // if using zip file installation
```

In normal cases, a time-sync must be done either for SteamAuth or individual SteamAuth instances. This sets the drift between the host computer and Steam servers needed to calculate the correct code.

```js
// Perform an initial time sync
SteamAuth.Sync(function(err)
{
	// we can now create instances
});
```
	
Time syncing can also be done on a per-instance basis, by event or callback.

```js
// create a single instance with ready event
var auth = new SteamAuth("KNUGC4TFMRJWKY3SMV2A====");
auth.once("ready", function()
{
	// auth can now be used
});


// create a single instance with callback
var auth = new SteamAuth("KNUGC4TFMRJWKY3SMV2A====", function(err)
{
	// auth can now be used
});
```

Creating SteamAuth instances can be done with a Base32 string or object with shared_secret.

```js
// simple example with a Base32 code (from WinAuth)
var auth = new SteamAuth("KNUGC4TFMRJWKY3SMV2A====");
var code = auth.calculateCode();

// example with options loaded from Android Steam mobile app
var auth = new SteamAuth({
	shared_secret:"U2hhcmVkU2VjcmV0"
});
var code = auth.calculateCode();
	
// calculate a code for a specific time (in ms)
var code = auth.calculateCode({time:1449690657000);
```

If you already have the correct time, you can just jump in and create codes.	


```js
// create an authenticator with no time sync
var auth = new SteamAuth({
	shared_secret: "U2hhcmVkU2VjcmV0",
	sync: false
});

// create code for specific time
var code = auth.calculateCode({time:1449690657000});

// quickly create a code for a known secret and time
var code = SteamAuth.calculateCode("KRUGS42JONGXSQ3PMVLTGRLH", 1449690657000);
```

### Trade Confirmations

Trade confirmations require a login to the SteamAuth instance. In this case, you must additionally pass in the deviceid and identity_secret from the steam authenticator.


```js
// create instance with options loaded from Android Steam mobile app
var auth = new SteamAuth({
	deviceid:"android:631471e5-00c8-4e9b-b0e9-45b69426cd09",
	shared_secret:"U2hhcmVkU2VjcmV0",
	identity_secret:"SWRlbnRpdHlTZWNyZXQ="
});
```

You can then login with username and password.

```js
// login the user
auth.login({
	username:"mysteamuser",
	password:"mypassword"
}, function(err, session)
{
// .....
});
```
	
Login can fail because of network errors, but also invalid password, authcode or a captcha is required. If a captcha is required, err will contain captchaid and captchurl properties. The captcha must be solved and passed back in to a new login.


```js
// login the user with captcha
auth.login({
	username:"mysteamuser",
	password:"mypassword",
	captchid:12345678,
	captchatext:"ABCDEFG"
}, function(err, session)
{
// ....
});
```
	
On login, you can get an array of the current trade confirmations.

```js
auth.getTradeConfirmations(function(err, trades)
{
	if (err || !trades.length) return;	
});
```

	
Trades are returned as summary objects containing: id:string, key:string, details:string, traded:string, when:string. The id and key are used to accept or reject.


```js	
// to accept a trade
auth.acceptTradeConfirmation(trade.id, trade.key, function(err)
{
	// trade has been accepted
});
		
// to reject a trade
auth.rejectTradeConfirmation(trade.id, trade.key, function(err)
{
	// trade has been rejected
});
```

## Logging

SteamAuth uses bunyan to log activity. You can get the logger instance at SteamAuth.Logger and set the level, e.g.

```js
// change logging to be "debug"
var SteamAuth = require("steamauth");
SteamAuth.Logger.level("debug");
```
	
Levels are "error", "warn", "info" and "debug". The default level is "warn".

Debug level logging will include all web request made to the Steam servers.
